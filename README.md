# 👋 Hi, I’m @enginmertcan

- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development, with a focus on **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I also have experience working with **Chakra UI**, **Firebase**, and **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **Next.js** and improving my skills in **TypeScript** while building scalable web applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve **React**, **Next.js**, or anything related to modern web development frameworks.
